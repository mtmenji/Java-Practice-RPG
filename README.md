# Overview

I wanted to learn the basics of Java, so I created an RPG game that consisted of classes and methods.

# Development Environment
I use VS Code as my development environment and Java as my programming language.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work
- Create functionality to add a weapon, armor, or item to the bag (it's currently being hardcoded).
- Remove "Discard a bag item" and replace it "Use Item".
- Add more weapons/armor.
- Make Room 1 it's own level class? So future rooms don't clutter main.
- Continue adding the other two rooms and enemies.
